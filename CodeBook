These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccelerationMean
tBodyAccelerationJerkMean
tBodyGyroscopeMean
tBodyGyroscopeJerkMean


The training and test data sets have been merged.  The variable names have been cleaned up so some of the abbreviations 
have been given more descriptive names.  The above names and headings are a general picture of the data set.  
The final data set for question 5 has 180 rows and 563 columns. The acivity label in the original data sets had 6 levels, 1 through 6,
but has now been changed to a physical descriptor (ie 1 = Walking).
